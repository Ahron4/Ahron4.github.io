## Writing Pesudocode to Writing Actual Code

I would like to say that it has really been a while (really!) since I was able to compile and write code! I spend most of the past few semesters hand-writing pseudocode and overall understanding algorithms, proving it's correctness, and finding it's runtime. It was a very hard process trying to prove correctness with an algorithm, but now that I understand basic algorithm analysis, I can finally do what computer scientists do best: writing and compiling actual code! My first impressions for ICS 314, Software Engineering was very ammusing as there was a lot of expections and a lot of things to do. Instead of understanding and proving basic sorting algorithms, there were various topics of interest that I was looking forward to, including understanding TypeScript, Next.js, UI design, and many more.

## New Skill Unlocked: TypeScript

After a few semesters of writing pseudocode, I kind of lost touch with my web development fundamental including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but thankfully, after a comprehensive review of these fundamentals through YouTube tutorials, Khan Academy, and FreeCodeCamp, I was able to get back in the game and get all caught up. When we were first introduced to TypeScript for the first time, I was ready to learn all the syntaxes, coding habits, and shortcut, but after noticing that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript I was actually relieved since I don't need to learn a whole new lanague, but rather brush up on my JavaScript and ES6 skills so that I can be an effective TypeScript programmer.

## Honorable Mention: JavaScript ES6

Oh! I forgot to metioned
