## Writing Pesudocode to Writing Actual Code

I would like to say that it has really been a while (really!) that I was able to complie and write code! I spend most of the past few semester hand-writing pesudocode and overall understanding algorithms, proving it's correctness, and finding it's runtime. It was a very hard process trying to understand and proving correctness but now that I understand basic algorithm analysis I can finally do what computer scientist do best; writing and compiling actual code!
