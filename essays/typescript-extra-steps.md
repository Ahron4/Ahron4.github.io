## Writing Pesudocode to Writing Actual Code

I would like to say that it has really been a while (really!) since I was able to compile and write code! I spend most of the past few semesters hand-writing pseudocode and overall understanding algorithms, proving it's correctness, and finding it's runtime. It was a very hard process trying to prove correctness with an algorithm, but now that I understand basic algorithm analysis, I can finally do what computer scientists do best: writing and compiling actual code! My first impressions for ICS 314, Software Engineering was very ammusing as there was a lot of expections and a lot of things to do. Instead of understanding and proving basic sorting algorithms, there were various topics of interest that I was looking forward to, including understanding TypeScript, Next.js, UI design, and many more.

## New Skill Unlocked: TypeScript

After a few semesters of writing pseudocode, I kind of lost touch with my web development fundamental including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but thankfully, after a comprehensive review of these fundamentals through YouTube tutorials, Khan Academy, and FreeCodeCamp, I was able to get back in the game and get all caught up. When we were first introduced to TypeScript for the first time, I was ready to learn all the syntaxes, coding habits, and shortcut, but after noticing that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript I was actually relieved since I don't need to learn a whole new lanague, but rather brush up on my JavaScript and ES6 skills so that I can be an effective TypeScript programmer.

## Honorable Mention: JavaScript ES6

Oh! I forgot to metioned how I was also introduced to JavaScript ES6 for the first time which apparently makes things really useful to us especially with the `let` and `const` keywords to help replace the old `var` keywords in ES5. We were also introcuted to shorter syntaxes like arrow functions in which, to my understanding, greatly changes codes like this:

```js
function add(a,b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
 to this:

 ```js
const add = (a,b) => a + b;
```

Which is a pretty neat shortcut, especially during the workouts of the days (WODs), which I will talk about later. There were other keywords that also interest me like the spread and rest operators, promisies, and destructuring assignment, which was pretty confusing to me but I beleive that with enough practice and understanding more about these features, I could maybe one day impress my future employer during a technical interview.

## Athletic Software Engineering

This was a really interesting pedagogy where I have seen many professors use the traditional teaching approach and recently a flipped classroom approach, where I was expecting ICS 314 to be one or the other, but that is not the case. Instead, the concept of ** Athletic Software Engineering ** involves just putting students through a high-intensity stressful approach to where students design and solve a problem
accurately and efficiently within the time limit. These problems are also know as ** Workouts of the Day ** or WODs for short. In my opinion, this kind of approach is not for me since being pressured by time causes me to think about the time limit during these WODs. I am not sure, but this is a very new approach that I am not used to, but I believe that understanding my weaknesses and mistakes might help improve my time during these WODs. As I continue my computer science journey, perhaps this kind of pedagogy might one day save me time on various problems I encounter in my journey, either through problem solving or even debugging huge amounts of code.
